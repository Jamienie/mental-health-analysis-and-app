### Overview
The tech sector is built on bright minds developing new solutions to create social and economic impact. Like many industries, the talent is the people. With this in mind, it is important to consider the well being and mental health of all employees to foster a great working environment.  We propose building a data visualization application to illustrate the attitudes around mental health, what companies are doing about it, and how this relates to the well being of the employees. Using this tool An HR manager can get a better understanding of theses attitudes for their company and act accordingly. By filtering the company benefits the user can also learn what company tools are most beneficial and can tailor it to their employees.

### Data
The source of the dataset is available publicly on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey). This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 
We will be visualizing this survey results for over 1,200 employees all over the world and primarily in the technology industry. This data is predominantly categorical, includes 27 variables but can be grouped into three sections: employee backgrounds, attitudes towards mental health, and company benefits / tools. Each of these sections include several variables which we aim to visualize by use of a 2d bin plot and several filters to visualize the interactions. In addition we will derive overall ranking variables on specific groupings to better summarize the data and provide useful insights.
