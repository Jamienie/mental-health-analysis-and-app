## Summary of Changes
The primary focus of this weeks application development was to continue improving the interpretability. Through the feed back sessions and further discussions with peers and teaching advisors, we identified several changes we could make to improve interpretability.

One major consideration was adding additional plots and tables. However given the limited time we chose to spend our efforts on making our current plot as clear and intuitive as possible. This meant tidying up instructions and making relevant information and functionality available to the user in a more natural way. The added improvements are listed below:
- Brief instructions right below the heading to supplement the Read me tab
- Hover text on the plot to detail the mental health survey questions for each data point and include the average positivity score
- Dynamic filter to toggle the employer policy options. This toggle was much more intuitive and visible compared to the legend toggle on the plot
- Improved axis labels to be more human readable
- Changed the application theme for a cleaner design

There was no shortage of challenges when implementing these improvements. Overall the biggest technical challenge was creating dynamic hover text while also considering the toggled data filters. The most conceptual challenge was understanding what changes given limited time will improve interpretability the most.

## Closing Remarks
This project was an excellent exercise to understand the importance of feed back. We experienced the curse of familiarity first hand and getting new user feedback was crucial to the overall development. In doing this application again or starting a new application, we will be much more quick to embrace suggestions. Another important take away was earning an appreciation for how challenging it can be to implement a lot of functionalities. Going forward we will be much better at striking a balance between personal visions and realistic implementations.
