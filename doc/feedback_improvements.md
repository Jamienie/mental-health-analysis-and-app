## Deployed Application:
The application has been deployed and can be accessed through the following link:

## Giving Feedback:
After reviewing applications of fellow classmates, we identified improvements and strengths which we communicated to them through github issues. These issues can be found through the following links.
- [Peer Review Feedback 1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/CrimeVisualizer/issues/18)  
- [Peer Review Feedback 2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Wine_Visualization_and_Analysis_Phuntsok_Jessie/issues/14)

## Receiving Feedback and Improvements:
The Feedback sessions were conducted first as a "fly on the wall" where classmates tried using our app with no assistance from us. Secondly we gave a traditional walk through of our application. This session and specific format highlighted points for improvements. This is discussed in two sections, Interpretability, and Functionality.

### Interpretability
First and foremost the most consistent issue with our app that was highlighted in the feed back session was the lack of titles, instructions, labels, and descriptions. This was evident in the time it took for new users to get an understanding of what exactly was being visualized. With out a guided walk through the users were unable to see the visuals the way we intended in our use case.

The suggestions that were provided on the topic of interpretability were to improve these labels and instructions. This is very reasonable given our time frame and were changes we made to our application. This included a title framed as a question to guide the user to the intended use case. In addition, we added instructions in the Read me tab to help the user understand the visualization without our assistance.

### Functionality
The drop down menu functionality was used as we expected. However the ability to toggle the legend was not obvious to the user until we showed them. Additionally some users tried to zoom into the radar plot but this functionality was finicky and not very insightful.

Suggestions to address these issues involved making the legend more obvious and closer to the drop down. It was also suggested to remove the zoom in ability. At this time we were unable to implement these suggestions but we aim to make these improvements going forward with our application.
